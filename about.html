        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques
            pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia.[11] A claim for the earliest Japanese animation
            is Katsudō Shashin (c. 1907),[17] a private work by an unknown creator.[18] In 1917, the first professional
            and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and
            Jun'ichi Kōuchi (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which
            is Kōuchi's Namakura Gatana.[19] Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in
            the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.[20] <br> <br>

            By the mid-1930s, animation was well-established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action
            industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers, such as Disney, and many animators, including
            Noburō Ōfuji and Yasuji Murata, continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel
            animation.[21] Other creators, including Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, nevertheless made great strides in
            technique, benefiting from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational
            shorts and propaganda.[22] In 1940, the government dissolved several artists' organizations to form the Shin
            Nippon Mangaka Kyōkai.[a][23] The first talkie anime was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka (1933), a short film
            produced by Masaoka.[24][25] The first feature-length anime film was Momotaro: Sacred Sailors (1945),
            produced by Seo with a sponsorship from the Imperial Japanese Navy.[26] The 1950s saw a proliferation of
            short, animated advertisements created for television.[27] <br> <br>
