        <h1>Industry</h1>
        <p>The animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with some of the major studios
            including Toei Animation, Gainax, Madhouse, Gonzo, Sunrise, Bones, TMS Entertainment, Nippon Animation,
            P.A.Works, Studio Pierrot and Studio Ghibli.[84] Many of the studios are organized into a trade association,
            The Association of Japanese Animations. There is also a labor union for workers in the industry, the
            Japanese Animation Creators Association. Studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly
            projects, as done with Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away.[84] An anime episode can cost between US$100,000 and
            US$300,000 to produce.[85] In 2001, animation accounted for 7% of the Japanese film market, above the 4.6%
            market share for live-action works.[84] The popularity and success of anime is seen through the
            profitability of the DVD market, contributing nearly 70% of total sales.[84] According to a 2016 article on
            Nikkei Asian Review, Japanese television stations have bought over ¥60 billion worth of anime from
            production companies "over the past few years", compared with under ¥20 billion from overseas.[86] <br> <br>
            There has
            been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in Japan, caused by late night anime with adults as the
            target demographic.[86] This type of anime is less popular outside Japan, being considered "more of a niche
            product".[86] Spirited Away (2001) is the all-time highest-grossing film in Japan.[87][88] It was also the
            highest-grossing anime film worldwide until it was overtaken by Makoto Shinkai's 2016 film Your Name.[89]
            Anime films represent a large part of the highest-grossing Japanese films yearly in Japan, with 6 out of the
            top 10 in 2014, in 2015 and also in 2016. <br> <br> <br>

            Anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released. While anime has
            been licensed by its Japanese owners for use outside Japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became
            well-established in the United States in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such TV series as Gatchaman and
            Captain Harlock were licensed from their Japanese parent companies for distribution in the US market. The
            trend towards American distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as
            Voltron and the 'creation' of new series such as Robotech through use of source material from several
            original series.[90] <br> <br>

            In the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented
            material. Some, such as A.D. Vision, and Central Park Media and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial
            commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative American anime market.
            Others, such as AnimEigo, achieved limited success. Many companies created directly by Japanese parent
            companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their American
            operations. <br> <br>

            Licenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one
            movie.[91] The prices vary widely; for example, Jinki: Extend cost only $91,000 to license while Kurau
            Phantom Memory cost $960,000.[91] Simulcast Internet streaming rights can be cheaper, with prices around
            $1,000-$2,000 an episode,[92] but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than US$200,000
            per episode.[93] <br> <br>
